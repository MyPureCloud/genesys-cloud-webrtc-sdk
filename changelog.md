# [v8.0.4](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v8.0.3...v8.0.4)
### Changed
* [PCM-2042](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2042) - Updated streaming client to pull in the sdp over xmpp handling. This change should be backward compatible even though a lot of the tests changed to use the `id` property on the session instead of the `sid` property.

### Fixed
* [PCM-2060](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2060) - Fixed issue allowing a user to have multiple video tracks. Fixed some minor issues in demo app.

# [v8.0.3](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v8.0.2...v8.0.3)
### Fixed
* [PCM-2058](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2058) - bump streaming client in order to get fixed stats-gatherer

# [v8.0.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v8.0.1...v8.0.2)
### Added
* [PCM-2053](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2053) - added a function to the sdk that allows changing `useHeadset` on demand.


# [v8.0.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v8.0.0...v8.0.1)
### Fixed
* [SERVOPS-33064](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/SERVOPS-33064) - Fixed issue where Jabra Native overwrites CEF registration, preventing the use of external links to place call

# [v8.0.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.4.2...v8.0.0)
### BREAKING CHANGES
* We have set the `useHeadsets` flag to default to false rather than true.  This way if a consumer of the SDK omits the headsets flag, it will default to using the original implementation rather than the new.  This has the user to opt in rather than opt out

* We have removed the `sdk.reconnect()` function. We updated the streaming client which includes a better approach to connection management. The `sdk.reconnect()` function
  made very little sense as it was and was little used. If you are using `sdk.reconnect()`, you'll instead need to do `await sdk.disconnect()` then `await sdk.connect()`.

### Fixed
* [PCM-2024](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2024) - bump streaming client (major) to pull in all the connect/reconnect changes

# [v7.4.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.4.1...v7.4.2)
* [PCM-2020](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2020) - Bump streaming-client and removed data-channel logs.

* [PCM-1998](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1998) - added in line to properly remove inactive calls from the list of current calls for consuming apps
* [PCM-2007](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-2007) - fixed issue with switching device during active call putting Jabra devices in bad state

# [v7.4.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.4.0...v7.4.1)
* [PCM-1968](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1968) - Bump streaming client for more verbose logging around interrupted connection states

# [v7.4.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.3.4...v7.4.0)
### Added
* [PCM-1972](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1972) - Connect WebRTC data channel for video.
* [PCM-1789](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1789) - Listen and emit `memberStatusMessage` when receiving a data channel message indicating someone is actively speaking.

### Fixed
* [PCM-1983](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1983) - Fixed an issue where the SDK throws an error when a new station is associated

### Added
* [PCM-1977](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1977) - Add a trace on beforeclose stating the window was closed and list the active conversations
* [PCM-1992](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1992) - Update client logger so unsent logs get saved and sent in the future

# [v7.3.4](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.3.3...v7.3.4)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1974](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1974) - Added in logic to properly handle auto answer scenarios
* [PCM-1975](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1975) - Added in logic to properly handle auto answer scenarios

# [v7.3.3](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.3.2...v7.3.3)
### Changed
* [PCM-1965](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1965) bump softphone vendor headsets

### Fixed
* [PCM-1944](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1944) pulled in the new streaming-client so requestApiWithRetry will actually retry
* [PCM-1966](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1966) fix a race condition when joining video and unmuting audio at the same time. We will now wait for the session to be stable before swapping the track on the sender.

# [v7.3.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.3.1...v7.3.2)
* [PCM-1856](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1856) touched up and improved function for handling resolution changes
* [PCM-1948](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1948) moved rxjs to be a full dependency rather than a dev dep.

# [v7.3.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.3.0...v7.3.1)
### Added
* [PCM-1856](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1856) added function to the SDK that allows users to update the default video resolution

### Fixed
* [PCM-1912](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1912) fixed rejecting non-acd softphone calls. They now go to voicemail.
* [PCM-1945](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1945) fixed the logging url to use the backgroundassistant suffix for jwt auth
* [PCM-1938](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1938) made small change so softphone session handling checks start with the most recent participant rather than the first

# [v7.3.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.2.3...v7.3.0)
### Added
* [PCM-1819](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1819) added jwt support for background assistant which will use separate endpoints for logging and screen recording metadata

### Fixed
* [PCM-1911](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1911) Added in logic to help with the ACD flow that checks for terminated/disconnected users if the user shows up twice in the participant update
* [PCM-1909](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1909) – force terminate sessions so sdk.destroy doesn't hang in the case of persistent connection or LA==1
* [PCM-1913](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1913) – Fixed the screen recording metadata request to use mids in place of trackIds.
* [PCM-1885](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1885) – on `deviceschange` event from the window, SdkMedia should only validate all sessions if the `sessionManager` has already been initialized.
* [PCM-1922](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1922) - update streaming client to 14

### Added
* [PCM-1993](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1933) – added build, deploy, and publish notifications to the Jenkinsfile

# [v7.2.3](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.2.2...v7.2.3)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1893](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1893) – added `useHeadsets: boolean` config option to allow "opting out" of the headset functionality.
  See [docs on constructing the SDK](doc/index.md#constructor) for more details.

# [v7.2.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.2.1...v7.2.2)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1887](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1887) – Fixed how we create fake pending sessions for when line appearance == 1. Missed reference during refactor.

# [v7.2.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.2.0...v7.2.1)

### Fixed
* Worked on issue found in Volt when there wasn't a proper device found after changing default devices
* [PCM-1878](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1878) – cleaned up logging for `sdk.acceptSession()` which was logging the HTML elements and media stream
  causing an infinite loop with the client-logger.
* Ran `npm audit fix` to update deps and resolve security vulnerabilities

# [v7.2.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.1.1...v7.2.0)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1668](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1668) - Installed newer version of headset library that will help with some issues that were found as well as offer a better approach to rejecting calls.

### Added
* [PCM-1668](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1668) - Integrate the new headset library into the SDK to allow device call controls for three headset vendors at the moment: Plantronics/Poly, Sennheiser/EPOS, Jabra

# [v7.1.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.1.0...v7.1.1)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1836](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1836) - Remove circular ref issue when logging the session when updating default devices.

### Changed
* [PCM-1387](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1387) - Made screenRecordingMetadata a required param for acceptSession for screen recording sessions; Those metadatas get sent to the server automatically.
* [PCM-1279](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1279) – calling `sdk.setAccessToken()` will now also pass
    that token down to the streaming-client and the client-logger.

# [v7.1.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v7.0.0...v7.1.0)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1802](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1802) - Fix screen recording sessions being characterized as collaborate video sessions.
* [PCM-1795](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1795) – Do not request media when `sdk.updateDefaultDevices({ updateActiveSessions: true, ... })`
  is called and the session is already using the requested deviceId.
* [PCM-1798](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1798) – Added logic to video session to check to make sure we received an initial conversation
  event from hawk. This fixes the issue where sometimes joining a video session happens before we subscribe and receive the initial conversation
    event from hawk – which leaves an empty list of participants in the session.
* [PCM-1812](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1812) – Switched station lookup to use the `effectiveStation` and not the `associatedStation`.
  `effectiveStation` is the station in use for the user. It is computed based on some of the other fields.
      * Tuned up some logging around accepting softphone sessions with LA == 1.
* [PCM-1821](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1821) – Fixed the way we add screen recording tracks so the tranceivers are not `recvonly`

### Added
* [PCM-1794](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1794) – added `sdk.media.on('gumRequest' evt)` to notify consumers when the SDK makes a request to the
  `widow.navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API. This helps consumers to react appropriately to handle browsers that will only fulfil `gUM()` requests
  if the window is in focus.
* [PCM-1797](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1797) – added `sdk.setDefaultAudioStream(stream)` and `sdk.media.setDefaultAudioStream(stream)` (same function)
  to allow changing the sdk default audio stream.

### Maintenance
* [PCM-1790](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1790) – switched over to use new pipeline.

# [v7.0.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.7...v7.0.0)
### BREAKING CHANGE
* If you are providing a *logger*:
    * the `ILogger` interface has changed. The last param for `log`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error` functions is no longer a simple boolean,
    it is an object. Please refer to the ILogger type for https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-client-logger.
* [PCM-1742](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1742) - Throws error and prevents session from starting if Streaming Client is not connected
* [PCM-1708](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1708) – CDN now exports all SDK exports and not just the client.
* Must use `conversationId`s when interacting with a conversation and/or webrtc-session. Most notable functions include (but are not limited to):
    * `sdk.acceptPendingSession({ conversationId: string })`
    * `sdk.rejectPendingSession({ conversationId: string })`
    * `sdk.acceptSession({ conversationId: string, ...otherOptions })`
    * `sdk.endSession({ conversationId: string, ...otherOptions })`
    * `sdk.setVideoMute({ conversationId: string, ...otherOptions })`
    * `sdk.setAudioMute({ conversationId: string, ...otherOptions })`
* `sdk.on('cancelPendingSession')` & `sdk.on('handledPendingSession')` will be called with:
  `({ sessionId: string, conversationId: string }) => void`. `conversationId` is not guaranteed to be present.
* [PCM-1769](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1769) – Removed `address` from the `pendingSession` object emitted on `sdk.on('pendingSession', ...)`.
  Use `roomJid` now.

### Added
* [PCM-1387](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1387) - Add the ability to do screen recordings
* [PCM-1784](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1784) – Add a function to be able to forcibly terminate sessions by sessionId
* [PCM-1753](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1753) – Add an option for log formatters
* [PCM-1755](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1755) – Added call error handling for softphone which will be emitted as a sdkError event with a type of `call`
* Added a static `VERSION` property
* Added top level SDK events of `'station'`, `'concurrentSoftphoneSessionsEnabled'`, `'conversationUpdate'` (see docs for more details on these events).
* Loads station on initialization _if_ `SesstionTypes.softphone` is in allowed list. Sets response to `sdk.station` and emits on `station` event.
* Added `sdk.setConversationHeld(options)` that makes an API request to place a softphone conversation on hold.
* Added functions `sdk.isPersistentConnectionEnabled()` and `sdk.isConcurrentSoftphoneSessionsEnabled()`

### Updated
* [PCM-1653](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1653) – ensure that all HTTP request errors emit on `sdk.on('sdkError', ...)`
* Updated Demo App to use new events

### Fixed
* [PCM-1764](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1764) – updated webpack config to skip `amd` build which was polluting the global namespace with
dependencies, namely lodash (`window._`).
* [PCM-1773](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1773) – add an `esModules` bundle for consumers to choose to use in builds. ([Initial bug report](https://developer.genesys.cloud/forum/t/issue-with-the-a-dependency-npm-package-for-the-sdk/11910))

# [v6.1.7](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.6...v6.1.7)

### Changed
* [PCM-1787](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1787) – CDN exports to **MAJOR** and **EXACT** versions. There will be _no_ more "latest" version to use. Examples:
  * `{rootUrl}/webrtc-sdk/v6/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.js` <- this URL will always load the _latest for that **major** version_.
  * `{rootUrl}/webrtc-sdk/v6.1.7/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.js` <- this will only ever load the specified version.
> Note: the current version (v6.1.6) deployed at `{rootUrl}/webrtc-sdk/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.js` will remain at this location. But this will no longer update to newer versions.

# [v6.1.6](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.5...v6.1.6)
### Changed
* Errors are now logged remotely
* Bumped streaming client to 13.3.7

### Removed
* Removed build examples for gulp and browserify and their dependencies


# [v6.1.5](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.4...v6.1.5)
### Added
* A static `VERSION` accessed at `GenesysCloudWebrtcSdk.VERSION`
* [PCM-1738](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1738) – Pulled in [GenesysCloudClientLogger](https://github.com/purecloudlabs/genesys-cloud-client-logger) v3.0.0 which changes how the SDK logs:
    * The logger will now send logs to the server if a logger is passed into the SDK on construction. The way to turn this off is to use the `optOutOfWebTelemtry` config option.
* [PCM-1754](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1754) – Removed several webrtc related logs as they will be logged by streaming-client ^13.3.4. Bumped to streaming-client v13.3.4
* [PCM-1738](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1738) – Pulled in streaming-client v13.3.3 (which also using gc-client-logger v3) and is now passing app name/version/id to the streaming-client's logger.

# [v6.1.4](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.3...v6.1.4)

### Fixed
* [PCM-1745](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1745) – Adding `process-fast` to webpack build to ensure the bundled CDN build does not get throttled in Chrome.
# [v6.1.3](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.2...v6.1.3)
### Added
* [PCM-1729](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1729) – Added `sessionType` to log messages (mainly `propose` and `session-init` events).
* [PCM-1715](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1715)/[PCM-1726](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1726) -
Bumped streaming-client to v13.3.1 which includes `stanza` override for ending sessions via the client. Now the client will manually close the peer connection if it is not closed automatically after sending `session-terminate`.
### Fixed
* [PCM-1726](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1726)/[PCM-1722](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1722) – Changed:
    * Renamed package.json `"browser" -> "web"` to prevent build tools from bundling the already web-bundled/built version of the SDK.
    * Pointed `"main": "dist/cjs/index.js"` (it was `dist/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.js` which was a hodge-podge webpack build with minimal deps bundled but target was still web). Most build tools should
      still be able to pick the commonJS built files when building. Note: the commonJS build does not bundle deps. The sdk is not intended to run in a node environment. If using the sdk cjs build
      in a node env, you must provide your own polyfills for certain browser specific APIs (suchas the `fetch` API).
    * `dist/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.js` is now the same file as `dist/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.bundle.js` which is built for the CDN (meaning all deps are bundled into the file). This is also true for the `.min` files as well.
    * Streaming-client bump also fixes a dependency file path issue.

# [v6.1.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.1...v6.1.2)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1711](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1711) - Changed default behavior for softphone `sdk.acceptSession` to create and use unique `HTMLAudioElement`s for each session.
It will then remove the audio element from the DOM once the session ends. Note: it will only create the unique audio element (and remove it from the DOM on `sessionEnded`) if `sdk.acceptSession` is _not_
passed an audioElement _and_ there is _not_ a SDK `defaults.audioElement`.
* [PCM-1587](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1587) - Ensure video-sessions pass up the `reason` to stanza for ending a session.

# [v6.1.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.1.0...v6.1.1)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1706](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1706) - Allow certain actions that affect the default to work before the sdk has been formally initialized.
* [PCM-1696](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1696) & [Issue #618](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/issues/618) - Ensure all modules are exported from barrel file.
* Correctly clean up mediaDevices `devicechange` event listeners inside SdkMedia class.
* Update `sdk.startSoftphoneSession` to not require a `SessionType`.

# [v6.1.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.0.1...v6.1.0)

### Maintenance
* Merged dependabot PRs
### Added
* [PCM-1669](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1669) - Added functionality to start softphone calls from SDK.
* [PCM-1624](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1624) - Added logging for failed HTTP requests to console, consuming formatRequestError from streaming-client to remove potential PII from errors.
* Exposed the `sdk.media.isPermissionsError(error)` function for consumers to be able to utilize. See [the docs for isPermissionsError()](doc/media.md#ispermissionserror).
* Added a `'both'` option to `sdk.media.requestMediaPermissions()`. See [the docs for requestMediaPermissions()](doc/media.md#requestmediapermissions).
* Added `preserveMediaIfOneTypeFails` & `retryOnFailure` to `IMediaRequestOptions`. See [the docs for IMediaRequestOptions](doc/media.md#imediarequestoptions).
### Fixed
* [PCM-1679](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1679) and [Issue #576](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/issues/576)– Fixed package.json `browser` and `module` fields, as well as added a `cjs` field. Added `core-util-is` (a dep of `stanza`) to compiled webpack build used under `main`and `browser` fields.
* [PCM-1693](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1693) - Fixed event listeners for media tracks by adding in a check for the amount of `audioTracks`; if no `audioTracks` are present, the default media stream is cleaned up. Also passed in value that represents the tracks to be removed which were not present previously.
* [PCM-1647](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1647) – Fixed issue where `requestedMicPermissions` would be
  `true` before we knew if `hasMicPermissions` was also `true` (same for `camera` permissions). This bug was causing
  it to be impossible for consumers to know for certain by looking at the `SdkMediaState` as to whether permissions
  were actually granted (due to the bad timing of setting the state).
### Deprecated
* Deprecting `retryOnFailure` function param for `sdk.media.startMedia(options, retryOnFailure)`. Moved to be an
  option in `IMediaRequestOptions`. See the **Added** section for this release for more info.
# [v6.0.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1628](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1628) – Fixed issue where debounce time was causing `users.{id}.conversations` subscription to fail.

# [v6.0.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v5.0.9...v6.0.0)
### Added
* Added internal option `reason` to the `IEndSessionRequest` interface
* Added `sdk.media` class to handle and emit media related tasks. See [media documentation](doc/media.md) for more details
  * `sdk.media.on(...)` event emitter.
  * permissions and device management housed in `sdk.media`
* [PCM-1510](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1510) – Be able to specify jidResource for clients (streaming client)
* [PCM-1538](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1538) – add `sdk.setAccessToken(token)` function to allow for updating the
  auth token on an already initialized sdk instance.
* [PCM-1576](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1576) - Be able to control audio volume on video and audio elements. see `sdk.updateAudioVolume`.

### Changed
* Updated documentation.
* extra audio constraints which were google only, now apply to all browsers
* A few audio constraints are configurable as sdk defaults
* [PCM-1514](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1514) – Guest acd screen share no longer cares about `config.autoConnectSessions`. Sessions were
  already auto accepted. That check was only throwing an error if `autoConnectSessions` was `false`.

### Fixed
* [PCM-1602](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1602) – fix errors when changing devices and there's no track on the sender
* [PCM-1509](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1509) – fixed sdk's `defaults.audioStream` to not be destroy when ending a session.
  Has Firefox limitations. See documentation.
* [PCM-1512](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1512) – fixed softphone and video `acceptSession` to respect media options of `null`
  as being `system default` requests.
* [PCM-1522](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1522) – fixed `sdk.updateOutgoingMedia()` to respect media options of `null`

### Breaking Change
* Updated configuration options for constructing an SDK instance (see [docs](doc/index.md) for new config)
  * Removed configuration option `iceServers: IceServerConfiguration[]` and `iceTransportPolicy`
  * Moved defaults into a nested `config.default = {}` object
* Changed `IAcceptSessionRequest`, `IEndSessionRequest`, and `ISessionMuteRequest` interfaces to require a `sessionId`
  in place of the non-descriptive `id` field. This contract change will impact calls to:
    * `sdk.acceptSession({sessionId: string;})`
    * `sdk.endSession({sessionId: string;})`
    * `sdk.setVideoMute({sessionId: string;})`
    * `sdk.setAudioMute({sessionId: string;})`
    * See [docs](doc/index.md) for method parameters
* Removed `sdk._refreshIceServers()` function which was not an advertised function. Refreshing ice servers is now handled in streaming-client directly

* Moved & renamed `sdk.createMedia(opts)` to `sdk.media.startMedia(opts)`
* Moved `sdk.getDisplayMedia(opts)` to `sdk.media.startDisplayMedia(opts)`
* `sdk.updateOutputDevice()` will now log a warning and do nothing if called in an unsupported browser.
  Old behavior was to throw an error.
* Updated `sdk.on('handledIncomingRtcSession', evt => {})` typing to be a `sessionId: string` and not an `IExtendedMediaSession`.
  Event already emitted the `sessionId`. This fixes the typing.

### Breaking Changes
* The SDK no longer supports legacy stream-based actions. Minimum required versions can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addTransceiver
* `SDK.on('error' ...)` has been changed to `SDK.on('sdkError' ...)`

### Changed
* Remove stats-gatherer so it can be moved up the dependency tree
* Updated to latest streaming-client

### Fixed
* [PCM-1454](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1454) – fix talker change events in Firefox. Root cause, the trackIds on FF RTCReceivers did not match the conversation tracks[].sinks for participants. Solution is to parse the remote SDP offer to attain the trackId from the msid.
* [PCM-1440](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1440) – changed `getUserMedia` [constraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) with a deviceId to be `ideal` rather than `exact` to avoid `NotFound` errors if called with a bad deviceId. Example:
``` js
constraints = {
  video: {
    deviceId: { ideal: 'device-id-hash' }
  }
};
```
* [PCM-1462](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1462) – Firefox does not switch camera when deviceId uses `ideal`. Switched to `exact` if the browser is Firefox

### Maintenance
* Merged dependabot PRs

# [v4.1.2](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1442](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1442) – added `audioElement.setSinkId` to `base-session-handler.ts#acceptSession()` so the sdk default output deviceId is used when accepting a video or softphone session.

### Maintenance
* Merged dependabot PRs

# [v4.1.1](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)
### Fixed
* [PCM-1408](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1408) – moved `getDisplayMedia` request to `startScreenShare` for acd-screenshare. Firefox needs a `userGesture` in order to request the screen.
The Request is now handled on `session-init`, but requested at the beginning (before the propose).
* [WC-801](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/pull/268) – added `@babel/plugin-transform-property-mutators` to webpack/babel plugins to properly polyfill cdn bundle for IE11.
* [PCM-1428](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1428) – in chrome, if you were using the system default audio device and then changed the default on the system level, the sdk would not start a audio with the new system default.

### Added
* [PCM-1426](https://inindca.atlassian.net/browse/PCM-1426) – better logging around devices. It will log devices in use we a session starts and when the devices change.

### Maintenance
* Merged dependabot PRs

* cdn url also changed to: https://sdk-cdn.mypurecloud.com/webrtc-sdk/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk.bundle.min.js
* Changed the build output and `package.json#main` to point at compiled src rather than bundling for node. There is still a `.bundle.js` version for the cdn.
* Upgraded to typescript v3.9.x which can potentially break projects using older versions of ts (ie. 3.6.x)

### Added
* Bumped `webrtc-stats-gatherer` to v8

### Added
* Added ideal frameRate constraint to screenShare and video
* Apply track constraints based on the media automatically

### Changed

### Fixed
* Fixed the context for the logging handlers

# [v3.6.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v3.5.1...v3.6.0)
### Added
* `startVideoConference` now takes an optional `inviteeJid` param for sending a propose to the `inviteeJid`
* pending sessions can now be rejected with the `rejectPendingSession` function

### Fixed
* When `mediaDevices` fires a `devicechange` event, the sdk will check to make sure all sessions have
media from devices that are still available. It will attempt to update if the media is no longer available
_or_ it will set the session mute if there are no devices available to switch to.

### Security
* Merged [PR#138](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/pull/138) bumping `minimist`

### Maintenance
* Merged dependabot PRs

### Added
* Support for input and output devices
* Screen pinning for video
* Better handling of the log buffer size to mitigate 413's received from the logging endpoint

### Changed
* sdk.startVideoConference and sdk.startScreenShare now return Promise<{ conversationId: string }>

### Fixed
* sdk.initialize will no longer resolve before ice servers are fetched
* Only log the parts of conversation updates we care about instead of the whole event

# [v3.1.0](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/genesys-cloud-webrtc-sdk/compare/v3.0.1...v3.1.0)

### Deprecated
* SDK config option `iceTransportPolicy`

#### Changed
* Moved code base to a typescript implementation
